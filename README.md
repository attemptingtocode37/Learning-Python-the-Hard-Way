# Learning-Python-the-Hard-Way

I will learn how to code well enough to get a job in the industry in a years time. I will go from little coding experience to a competent level in this time. The first major resource I am using is a book called 'Learning Python the Hard Way'. In this repository, I will be documenting (nearly) all of the exercises that I will complete in the book.
